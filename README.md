You've probably heard about the new, innovative and "2018" OnePlus product. No, I'm not talking about the amazing new Wireless Buds, I'm talking about the new block that is destined to fall into your hand. The "OnePlus 6".

If you tuned in to the live event, you've probably heard that Carl Pei said during the process of making this phone, they don't just go with trends and implement features based on necessity and customers feedback. Well, if we dared to believe that statement, you got let down a few minutes later, when they released the first full OnePlus 6 picture, containing, surprisingly, a notch.

OnePlus used to be a company that breaks barriers. Giving us great quality in great prices. Hears exactly what the users need. And lately, they slowly began to stop caring about the customers with OP5T shipping with Nougat and not having Treble, and I was personally let down when I realized my awesome OnePlus 3T won't have a major update beyond Oreo. 

But the notch, the notch is where it crosses the lines. There is no need in such notch, There is no need to be all "apple-ish". I would rather to have a small bezel like the Samsung devices have. And as I figured out, I'm not the only one thinking this way. So I thought of a creative way to test OnePlus' loyalty to the customers for once and for all. 

Introducing ***#WeWillNeverSettle*** campaign by Idoideas, a creative way to gain the power of the community for the main cause - to remove the notch on the next generation of OnePlus.

## So how it works?

On this campaign site, on the Main tab, you can see a counter. This counter counts the sum of times people would've removed the notch if they could. To put this statement to a real test, I released a OnePlus 6 notch simulator to the Play Store, called [OneMinus Notch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.idoideas.sometimessettle).

When it's off you "never settle", but if you turn it on, you're like OnePlus nowadays, and "sometimes settle". Every time you stop the notch after you started it, and go back to "never settle", the counter increases by 1. The site is used as a public petition to OnePlus, to show them that people don't want the notch. 

This main site is a public petition to OnePlus, to show them that people don't want the notch.

Now, you must be saying, "petitions usually don't solve problems in real life, and I won't bother to contribute to it". And because I really do care about this cause (and stopping the notch trend in general), I decided to make it interesting.

You can see that the site has a leaderboard for the 5 top users with the most Notch Removals. The signed user that will have the most Notch Removals at the launch of the OnePlus 6T, will receive a ***6Teen dollars (16$) Amazon Gift Card right to his E-mail courtesy by Idoideas, no strings attached!***

So go on and contribute to this great cause! And hopefully we could make OnePlus listen to its' customers additional one time.
